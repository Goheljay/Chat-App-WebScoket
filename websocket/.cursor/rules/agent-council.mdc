# AI Agent Council — Always Follow the Spec

When working on any Agent Council feature, page, or component, **always follow** the requirements in:
`/home/dev1010/Jay/self-project/chat-app/websocket/AGENT_COUNCIL_SPEC.md`

## Critical: Agent Colors (never change these)
```
Analyst     ⚡  GPT-4o          #e84c3d  (red)
Researcher  🔬  Claude Opus     #3d7ee8  (blue)
Reasoner    🧠  Gemini 1.5 Pro  #38b06f  (green)
Critic      ⚖️  Llama 3 70B     #c9a84c  (gold)
Synthesizer ✦   Claude Sonnet   #9b59b6  (purple)
```

## Critical: UI Rules
- Background: `#0a0a0f` (dark ink)
- SEND button: `#e84c3d` (accent red) — NOT green
- Final Answer block: `border: rgba(232,76,61,0.3)`, `bg: rgba(232,76,61,0.1)` — red tint
- Agent left-border strips: 3px solid agent color
- Debate cards left-border: 2px solid agent color
- Body text: dim `rgba(255,255,255,0.45)` — NOT green
- Agent names only use their accent color; all other text is grey/white

## Layout
Three panels: `280px sidebar | flex-1 chat | 300px deliberation`

Sidebar footer: phase dots (done=green, active=gold pulsing) + `DEBATE` label
Right panel footer: consensus vote split bar + `N/5 agents aligned`

## Spec File
Always read `AGENT_COUNCIL_SPEC.md` for full details on:
- Backend 7-layer architecture
- Session state machine (RECEIVED → DISPATCHED → DELIBERATING → SYNTHESIZING → COMPLETE)
- Agent JSON message contract
- WebSocket event types
- Key design decisions (parallel fan-out, weighted voting, streaming)
